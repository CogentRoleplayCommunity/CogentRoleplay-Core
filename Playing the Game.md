# Playing the Game
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
The following chapter covers the basic rules that Players will need to play the game.  *Narrators* will have additional rules and tools in the *Running the Game* chapter.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## Building a Character
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

### CHARACTER SHEET
<!-- Put Character Sheet Here -->

### Character Creation

The Character Creation process is the standard method to create new Cogent Characters. Some Narrators may provide other Character Creation methods for specific Settings and Stories, but these rules will be compatible across all Cogent games. 

**An overview of the process is:**

* **Character Identity:** Create your Character narratively.
* **Attributes:** Assign Attribute Points.
* **Vocations:** Choose a Vocation and Specialisations.
* **Skills:** Assign Skill Points to Core Skills and Specialisations.
* **Purchase Equipment:** Assign Commerce Points and purchase equipment.
* **Finishing Touches:** Assign Destiny Points. Share your Character with your group and Narrator for approval.

#### Character Identity

Cogent Roleplay is a tabletop roleplaying game, meaning playing your character is like acting out a part in a play or film. Cogent aims for a narrative focus, so you are encouraged to start with a vision of your characters personality before worrying about the numbers. Your biggest priority is to create a character that is fun for you to play. They’ll likely be with you for the entire story you tell with your game group. Using the tools below can help ensure you create a creat character.

##### Character Concept

Your Character Concept is the core idea behind your character, the basic premise of who they are, the seed of the idea you will develop. Whether it be the classic wizard alone in a tower, an exploration of an atheist rebel turned to the priesthood, or an attempt to make the most average villager possible, this concept helps you focus on building a Character idea you are inspired to create.
If you don’t have a character concept in mind already, or are struggling to think of one, there are a few ways you can get started.

Start by getting to know your game's setting, to understand what Characters will best fit in your game. Every setting has its own archetypes, which can be a helpful guide to which options for a Character will fit well within the game's world. For instance, the five most common classes in Dungeons and Dragons form its archetypes, the Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Bard, and Cleric.

If you’re feeling stuck, these archetypes are a good starting point.  You can start by choosing one of the archetypes you feel drawn to, but keep in mind that some of the greatest ideas present a twist on the classic archetype. For example, instead the usual Thief with a tragic background, perhaps your character is a well-respected noble with a very privileged upbringing who uses the abilities of the Theif class to spy for their nation. 

Write down this Character Concept on your Character Sheet.

##### Elevator Pitch

Now that you have a Character Concept, imagine you are pitching the idea to a movie or book publisher on the elevator ride down to their office. You'll have to finish your pitch before the elevator stops, meaning you have at most two minutes to do so, and you will need to be clear and engaging. 

An example would be,

> Olga was an orc raised in a human town, where she never fit in.  One day, bandits raided her town. She was the hero who stopped them.  Now, Olga is the protector of her town. She is seeking allies to protect those she loves the most.

Write your Elevator Pitch on your Character Sheet.

##### Flesh it Out

Write some short notes to flesh out the details of your Character, who they are, what they did before the events of the campaign, what their motivations are, and what they want most in life. 

To create a well-developed character, be sure to cover the following:

* Where your Character was born and raised.
* Any allies and enemies your Character has made along the way.
* Your Character's "Call to Quest" (What set them on the path to join the campaign adventure).
* Your Character's goal(s) in life (What do they want to be when they grow up? What change do they want to see in the world? What grudges do they hope to resolve? What do they want to accomplish before they die).

While it may seem tempting to go into great detail, only a few bullet points are needed for each of these areas. Keep in mind that your Narrator will be reviewing your character too, and you would want to give them a manageable amount to read. It is best to be more general, as your Narrator may want to incorporate your background into the campaign story, and they will need something easy to work into their setting. For example, developing the exact layout and culture of the wealthy town called Jakobston where your character was raised might be tough for your Narrator to work with in a setting where Jakobston does not exist. Instead, simply saying your character is from "a wealthy town" will allow your Narrator to connect you directly to one of the wealthy towns your game group comes across during their adventure.

Now that you have created your Character narratively, it is time to start building them for gameplay.

#### Attributes

In TTRPG games, an **Attribute** describes a Character's general natural abilities in certain areas. For example, think of a brainy student who can solve any academic problem quickly, even if they haven’t studied the particular subject at hand. This person does well at most intellectual tasks thanks to their inherent brainpower. If they were a Character, they would likely have a high score in the **Intelligence Attribute. **

Cogent Roleplay uses four **Attributes**; 

* **Strength (STR):** Raw physical power. Used for tasks like pushing a heavy boulder, enduring a long fall, or winning a fistfight.
* **Relfex (RFL):** Physical cooridination and the five senses. Used for tasks like reacting quickly to a sudden explosion, balancing on slippery ice, or using a sewing needle.
* **Intelligence (INT):** Brainpower, logic, and reasoning. Used for tasks like solving logic puzzles, researching information on a suspect, or operating a mechanical device.
* **Charisma (CHA):** Social skills. Used for tasks like negotiating a discount, convincing a guard to let you past the gate, or telling a foolproof lie.

Depending on your starting **Tier** of Play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)*, use the table below to determine your starting **Attribute Points (AP)**.  These can be assigned to any of the **Attributes**.  There are no restrictions on how many **AP** can be assigned per **Attribute**, only that you have a limited number of **AP** across all your **Attributes**.

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **AP** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

#### Vocations

In **Cogent Roleplay**, **Vocations** fill the same role as Archetypes or Classes in other TTRPGs.  They are the profession your Character has been trained in.  It is assumed that your Character knows the essentials of your **Vocation** at the level for which they have been trained (Apprentice for 1 rank, Journeyman fo 2 ranks, Tradesmen for 3 ranks, and Master for 4 ranks).

Depending on your starting **Tier** of Play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)*, use the table below to determine your starting **Vocation Points (VP)**.  These can only be assigned to **Vocation** ranks, and can not be used for Skills or Specialisations.  Depending on your starting **Tier** of play, Characters will have a maximum limit of **VP** they can spend per **Vocation**.  
Characters may use **Skill Points (SP)** as **VP**, but the maximum **VP** limit remains.

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **VP** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |
| **Max VP** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 |

#### Skills

**Skills** define the specific strengths and weaknesses of a Character, shaping how your character can be played by where they excel and struggle. For instance, a diplomat who excels at negotiations might be strong in Charisma-based skills, as well as skills like Perception, but might struggle at physical tasks and thus have lower Strength-based skills. Cogent Roleplay has 12 **Skills** divided between the 4 **Attributes.** There are also infinite options for customized abilities called **Specialisations.** These are unique Skills that may be created by Players or preset a part of a campaign setting. They will relate to a Character’s **Vocation.**

**The 12 Skills are:**

**Strength:**
* **Athletics:** Raw physical power.  This covers all types of physical activities, such as lifting, running, gripping, throwing, etc.
* **Brawling:** Basic fighting skills.  This covers the general ability to punch and kick. This can also be used to intimidate through displays of frightening physical strength.
* **Endurance:** "Push through the suck!"  This covers the ability to perform a task despite any pain or discomfort.

**Reflex:**
* **Dexterity:** Balance and coordination.  This covers all types of physical activities that require fine motor control, such as parkour, tightrope walking, working with small or delicate objects, etc.
* **Perception:** Sensing. This covers quickly reacting to sudden events, assessing threats, keenly observing details, or anything using the five senses.
* **Stealth:** Sneaking. This covers moving while unnoticed, hiding, or any other instance of acting while undetected.

**Intelligence:**
* **Crafting:** The construction and comprehension of machines.  This covers anything involving understanding, repairing, and replicating simple devices. (More complex devices require **Specialisations** to  manipulate.)
* **General Knowledge:** The ability to recall key information from past events. General Knowledge comes from experiences, while in-depth studies of a specific field of knowledge will require a **Specialisation.** For example, an old woman would know that her aching bones meant it was about to rain (General Knowledge), while a meteorologist would know that a drop in air pressure meant a storm was coming (Specialisation).
* **Reasoning:** Problem-solving abilities. This covers solving puzzles, deducing hidden meanings, or seeing connections between different points of evidence.” 

**Charisma:**
* **Deception:** Lying.  This covers any type of misinformation, including blatantly lying, withholding the truth, and misdirection.
* **Intuition:** Sensing motives.  The ability to understand another person's intentions.  Used to better help or hinder others.
* **Persuasion:** Social skills. This covers diplomacy, charm, and other social interactions involving convincing another party.

Your Narrator may present you with preset **Specialisation** options tied to your game’s setting. You may also define them yourself. **Specialisations** need to be closely related to your **Vocation.** They will define how your Character expresses their **Vocation** in gameplay.  

Depending on your starting **Tier** of Play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)*, use the table below to determine your starting **Skill Points (SP)**.  These can be assigned to **Skills**, **Specialisations**, or **Vocations**.  
Depending on your starting Tier of Play, there will be a maximum limit to how much **SP** your Character can spend per **Skill or Specialisation.** Furthermore, **Spacialistions** cannot have more SP than the VP in their parent Vocation.

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **SP** | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |
| **Max Skill** | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 4 |

#### Equipment

**Cogent Roleplay** uses **Commerce Points** as a simple method to track a Character's wealth, in place of a currency system.  **Commerce Points** represent a combined measure of all salaries, inheritances, cash reserves, debt, and other financial resources they can pull on.  

Depending on your starting **Tier** of Play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)*, use the table above to determine your staring **Commerce Points (CP)**. These can be modified with **Quirks of Wealth (Quirks)**. 

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CP** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |
| **Quirks** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 2 |

##### Quirks of Wealth

Characters will have a maximum of **Quirks** they can take, determined by their starting Tier.  Taking a **Quirk of Wealth** increases the Character's **Commerce Points** by 1.  All **Quirks** come with restrictions that must be applied, or the Character will lose that Quirk and the associated +1 CP).

Choose from the table below to determine your Character's **Quirks of Wealth:**

| **Quirk** | **Restriction** |
| --- | --- |
| Scrooge | You will not spend a cent on anyone except yourself. |
| Patron | You are supported by a patron, and can not refuse their requests. |
| Expensive Tastes | There is an aspect of your life where you will not accept anything but the best (food, wine, lodging, etc). |
| Philanthropist | You are extremely charitable to those in need (even if it's to your detriment). |
| Loan Shark | You owe money to a person or group that expects a full return on their investment (including interest).  No exceptions. |
| Hidden Price | You got your wealth by offering a favour, one that comes with consequences. |
| Tight Pursed | You will always seek the cheapest option possible. |
| Blood Money | Your wealth comes from the many skeletons in your closet. |
| Family Ties | Your money is controlled by another member of your family. |
| Fame | You are a celebrity whose fame grants you gifts wherever you go, at the cost of privacy. |
| Debt | Your wealth is due to unpaid debt.  You must pay off the interest or risk losing your CP. |
| Stolen | You gained your wealth by stealing it.  Someone will very much want it back. |
| Elitist | You treat people with lower CP as inferior to you. |
| Ladder Climber | You have clawed your way up in this world by sucking up to those with higher CP than you. |
| Sugar Daddy/Momma | You use money as a means to show affection, buying love from those you find attractive. |
| Monopoly | You have cornered the market in a niche business.  As long as you maintain your monopoly, you will maintain your CP. |
| Unethical Business | Your wealth was earned at the cost of the blood, sweat, and tears of your underlings.  |
| Blackmail | Your wealth is obtained by hush money from a wealthy "benefactor". |
| Risky Investor | You have a habit of investing in risky opportunities.  So far it has paid off. |
| Employees | You have employees working under you.  If you do not support their CP, you will lose your CP. |

#### Finishing Touches

**Cogent Roleplay** has a luck mechanic called **Destiny**.  **Destiny** is applied in two ways. The first is **Destiny Points**, and second is the **Destiny Roll** (covered later in Playing the Game).  **Destiny Points** are used before or after any **Dice Pool** roll, and directly affect the results of the roll.

Depending on your starting **Tier** of Play *(see **[Tier Progression](#tier-progression)**)*, use the table below to determine your startng **Destiny Points (Starting Destiny).** You will gain **1 Destiny Point** per Chapter (usually 1-3 campaign sessions), until reaching your **Maximum Destiny (Max Destiny)**.

| Tier | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Starting Destiny** | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| **Max Destiny** | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 5 |

After your Character is done, share it with your Narrator and the other Players.  This gives the Group the ability to provide feedback. Work together to make sure each Player's Character fits in the campaign, and has good chemistry together. If your Narrator gives you notes to better adapt your character to the game world, this does not mean you have created a bad character. The best stories are built when everyone's ideas can mesh together seamlessly.

Now that your Character is ready, you can begin gameplay.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## Tier Progression
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

Like every great story, Characters in Cogent are expected to have a Narrative Arc.  Each Character will grow from their experiences, eventually developing into an idealized version of themselves.  While the campaign story will naturally cover a Character's Narrative Arc through roleplaying, **Tier Progression** covers the mechanics of experience and growth.

A typical Cogent Roleplay campaign is broken into segments of four different types: Campaign, Story Arcs, Chapters, and Scenes *(see **[Story Structure](/Running%20the%20Game.md/#story-structure)**)*.  

Characters can typically expect the following reward per campaign segment (Note there may always be exceptions):

* **Scene:** No reward
* **Chapter:** Characters receive **+1 Skill Point** for in an area where they ave grown significantly.
* **Story:** All Characters increase their **Tier** by one level.
* **Campaign:** This is the end of the game story, with no rewards left to be granted.  However, all Characters should have reached the Legend Tier by this point.

There are six **Tiers of Play** in **Cogent Roleplay**.  The Players and Narrator will agree on the **Tier** used for the campaign before **Character Creation**.  Most One-Shot campaigns will be set at **Tier 2 - Adventurer**.

| Tier | Name | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | Beginning | Only for specific scenarios intended to have very weak characters, like horror stories or background NPCs. |
| 1 | New Adventurer | "Call to Adventure!"  Standard starting point for most lengthy campaigns.  Characters are weaker than typical Cogent Characters. |
| 2 | Adventurer | "Crossing the Threshold!"  Starting point for most One-Shots.  The average Cogent Character is in this Tier. |
| 3 | Veteran | "The Ordeal!"  These Characters have already overcome some significant challenges.  They are more powerful than the average Cogent Character. |
| 4 | Hero | "The Return!"  These Characters have completed at least one Campaign, and are likely well-known in parts of their game setting.  They are some of the most powerful Cogent Characters. |
| 5 | Legend | "God Tier!"  These Characters are considered legendary in their game world, and their presence will dictate the course of action in the campaign's story.  These Characters should only be reserved for specific scenarios intended to have very strong characters, like gods or superhero stories. |

### Tier Resources and Limits

The following chart details the **Character Creation** resources the Player will get by Tier, as well as the limits to Attributes, Vocations, Skills, Specialisations, and other resources.

| Tier | AP | VP | SP | Max Vocation | Max Skill | CP | Destiny |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 0 | 0 | 4 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0/1 |
| 1 | 1 | 0 | 8 | 1 | 1 | 2 | 0/2 |
| 2 | 2 | 1 | 12 | 2 | 2 | 3 | 1/3 |
| 3 | 3 | 1 | 16 | 3 | 3 | 4 | 2/4 |
| 4 | 4 | 2 | 20 | 4 | 4 | 5 | 3/5 |
| 5 | 5 | 2 | 24 | 4 | 4 | 6 | 5/5 |
| +1 | +1 | +0.5 | +4 | * | * | +1 | * |

* The last row indicates points added when a Character moves up a **Tier**.  Only apply whole values (i.e. if the value would increase from 1 to 1.5, your value is still 1).
* Where there is a * value, apply the **Character Creation** value for the new **Tier** the Character has achieved (i.e. Tier 3 Max Skill = 3).

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->
## Dice Pools
<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

While Cogent is a story-driven roleplaying game, there are times when a Player can not resolve a situation by roleplaying alone.  When this happens, Cogent uses the **Dice Pool** mechanic. Dice Pools are a collection of six-sided dice, or D6, used to make dice rolls that will determine whether a desired outcome succeeds or fails.

### Calculate your Dice Pool

The number of dice in your **Dice Pool** is determined by the following factors:

* **Base Dice:** 3D6 (unless stated otherwise)
* **Attribute:** Every **Core Skill**, **Vocation**, and **Specialisation** has an associated **Attribute**.  Add D6 equal to the associated **Atribute Points** to your **Dice Pool**
* **Skill:** Add D6 equal to the points in the **Core Skill** or **Specialisation** you are using to your **Dice Pool**
* **Vocation:** If you are making a roll with a Skill associated with your **Vocation**, add D6 equal to the associated Vocations's **VP** to your **Dice Pool**
* **Modifiers:** There are several other factors that can add or remove D6 from your **Dice Pool**.  These include but are not limited to: Injuries, Equipment, environmental conditions, and other factors declared by the Narrator

### Narrator Declares the CL

A **Challenge Level (CL)** representations the difficulty of the task a Player makes a dice roll to achieve. More difficult tasks have higher CLs, meaning characters will need more proficiency - and therefore larger **Dice Polls** - to complete them. All tasks attempted will resolve successfully regardless of the result of his dice rolls. However, rolling poorly still has consequences. Things will go wrong, making future tasks more difficult to complete, and raising the stakes.  

Typically, CLs reflect scenarios with the following level of difficulty:

| **CL** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | Called an Open Roll.  For tasks with no chance of consequences. |
| 1 | Negligible Risk.  For tasks with little chance of consequences. |
| 2 | Low Risk.  For tasks with a probable but still unlikely chance of consequences. |
| 3 | Standard Risk. For tasks with an average risk of consequences. Most roles will have a 3CL rating.  |
| 4 | High Risk. For tasks with a likely chance of consequences. |
| 5 | Signifigant Risk.  For tasks with a highly serious chance of consequences. |
| 6 | Critical Risk.  Any CL greater than CL5 should be used for tasks where consequences are almost certain. |

The consequences from a Dice Roll will vary from roll to roll, but always will be relevant to the Action being performed.  The Narrator may indicate possible consequences to Players prior to a Dice Roll.

### Calculate Narrative Success or Failure

If a Character has a **Dice Pool** that is **greater** than the CL, the Character is capable of completing the task at hand.  Dice rolls are used to determine how well they accomplish the task at hand.  This is determined by calculating **Wins** and **Losses** and comparing them to the CL.

* **Wins and Loses**
  When rolling a Dice Pool, any D6 that lands on a 4, 5, or 6 is considered a **Win.** Otherwise, it is considered a **Loss**.
* **Advantage and Disadvantage**
  Before making a roll, the Narrator may declare the **Dice Pool** has **Advantage** or **Disadvantage**.<br/>
  If the **Dice Pool** has **Advantage**, a roll of 3, 4, 5, or 6 will be counted as a **Win**.<br/>
  If the **Dice Pool** has **Disadvantage**, only a roll of 5, or 6 is counted as a **Win**.
* **Narrative Success or Failure**
Narrative Success represents strokes of luck, incredibly favorable outcomes, or a performance that goes above and beyond the desired result. Cogent encourages Narrators to interprent success beyond simply passing a check, also flavoring the outcome with a positive influence on the scene at hand (the lock takes less time to pick, the sword found the gap in the armour, the bard is inspired by their muse, etc), The higher the Narrative Success, the greater the strokes of luck. Narrative Success occurs when a dice roll generations more **Wins** than the **Challenge Level.**<br/>
Conversely, Narrative Failure occurs when a dice roll generates fewer **Wins** than the **Challenge Level**.  Cogent Roleplay encourages the story to "Fail Forward," creating consequences that affect the direction of a scene in meaningful ways, rather than simply failing to hit a number than can be attempted over an over. For instance, rather than rolling several times until a character inevitably picks a lock, the Narrator may instead declare that the lockpick breaks. The Narrator should treat Narrative Success as complications (the lock pick breaks, the sword deflects off the armour, the bard has writer's block, etc). These complications will hinder the Character, but will not prevent them from accomplishing the task.

*To give an Example:*

> Erin the Mage wants to strategically cast a fireball into a group of goblins.  The Narrator determines that they will need to roll a Sorcery check, a **Specialisation** tied to their **Mage Vocation**.
>
> * Erin's Player first calculates Erin's **Dice Pool** as 6D6.  3D6 (Base) + 1D6 (Intelligence) + 1D6 (Mage Vocation) + 1D6 (Sorcery)
> * The Narrator reminds Erin's Player about their equipment - in this case, their *Wand of Power* - and tells them to add +1D6 to their **Dice Pool.** This gives Erin a total of 7D6.
> * Further to this, the Narrator tells the Player the goblins are completely unaware of Erin's presence, meaning and they have **Advantage** on their **Dice Pool**.
> * The Narrator feels that the fireball, a powerful spell, would be a significant strain on an average Mage.  The Narrator decides to set the task at a CL 3.
> * Erin's Player rolls their dice and gets 1, 3, 3, 4, 4, and 5.  Because of their Advantage, any number 3 or higher counts as a **Win.** This generates 5 Wins, or a Narrative Success of +2.
>
> The fireball lands on the group of goblins, setting them all on fire.  The spell casting is so effective that all of the goblings receive second-degree burns from the fire.

### Assists and Collaborations

Many hands make quick work.  In Cogent, there are two mechanics Characters can use to help each other out. The first is called **Assists**, and the second is called **Collaborations**.<br/>
**Assists** are when the results of one Character's dice roll directly affect those of another Character's dice roll.  When any Character declares they are making a dice roll, another Character can declare they would like to make an **Assist**.  They must declare what skill they are using, and describe how this will be used in **Assisting** the first Character at their task. The Narrator will set the CL based on how likely the **Assist** will benefit the **Assisted** dice roll. The Narrator may apply the results in the following ways:

* **Temporary Destiny Points:** The **Assisted** dice roll has either temporary Destiny Points for that role only or a reduction of how many of the Character's Desitny Points can be spent on that roll only.
* **Modify the CL:** The CL the **Assisted** dice roll is attempting to beat may be increased or decreased as per the Narrator's discretion
* **Add Modifier Dice:** The Narrative Success or Failure becomes **Modified** dice for the **Assisted** dice roll.

*To Give an Example:*

> Rick the Ranger is setting up the campsite for his adventuring party and must succeed at a CL3 Wildcraft check to do so.  To **Assist** in this, Paula the Paladin has decided to gather firewood, and Steve the Sorcerer has decided to use Sorcery to help start the fire.  The Narrator has Paula make a Survival check against a CL 3 to find firewood, and she generates a -1 Narrative Failure, resulting in her coming back short on the needed amount of wood.  The Narrator says this is a setback, but doesn't directly hinder Rick's attempts to set up camp. Rick receives -1 to his Destiny Pool for his Wildcraft check.  Steve makes a Sorcery check against a CL 2 and generates +4 Narrative Successes.  The Narrator says this is saves Rick a bunch of time trying to get the fire going. As a result, the CL is reduced by 2.  Rick makes his Wildcraft skill check against a new CL 1 (3 -2) and generates +3 Narrative Successes.<br/>
> The adventurers have a filling meal and a great night's rest.

**Collaborations** occur when multiple Characters are attempting the same dice roll at the same time.  All Characters will roll using their individual **Dice Pools** against a CL calculated for the group.  The Narrator should determine the group CL by multiplying the CL for the average individual to complete their portion of the group work by the average number of people needed to complete the group task. 

*To Give an Example:*

> The adventurers are attempting to escape, but the portcullis is down.  Paula the Paladin encourages the group, saying "All together now!", as everyone attempts to lift the portcullis.<br/>
> The Narrator determines that if 4 Characters of average Athletics were to attempt this lift, it would be possible, but hard. The Narrator would set a CL 3 for each Character, but multiplies this by the average number of 4 Characters needed for the lift to determine the CL for the Collaboration.  The Narrator tells the group that the Collaboration CL is **CL 12** **(CL 3x4)**.<br/>
> The Adventurers make their rolls and get 3, 2, 2, 3 Wins each  - a total of **10 Wins,** or **-2 Narrative Failure.**  Since the combined **Dice Pools** of all Characters is greater than the CL, the Narrator states that they succeed in lifting the portcullis, but it isn't dropped properly when they go under, so each Character is injured by the drop.

### Scale

There will be times when Characters will face opponents that are larger or smaller than them or use equipment that greatly increases their ability to manipulate the world around them.  This is called **Scale.** <br/>
Any Character or Item significantly larger or smaller than the standard Player Character in the game setting (i.e. human adult size) will be denoted with a **Scale Modifier.**  Using the chart below, modify the Narrative Success/Failure accordingly.  

| **Target's Scale** | -6 | -5 | -4 | -3 | -2 | -1 | 0 | +1 | +2 | +3 | +4 | +5 | +6 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Result Adjustment** | +15 | +11 | +8 | +5 | +3 | +1 | +0 | -1 | -3 | -5 | -8 | -11 | -15 |

If two or more Characters have a **Scale Modifer**, adjust the modifiers while **keeping the same difference between them** as if the character with the **smallest** modifier is set at 0.  Only the results of the Dice Roll are modified, and Narrative Successes can not be turned into Narrative Failures (and vice versa).

*To Give an Example:*

> An Ogre (+1 Scale) is trying to smash a Pixie (-1 Scale).  
> The Narrator adjusts the scale modifier for the Ogre to be +2 Scale, and the scale of the Pixie to be 0 Scale (setting the smaller scale to 0).
> The Ogre rolls Narrative Success of 0 and adds the +2 Scale modifier to get a total of Narrative Success of 2 (Level 2 Injury before Armour).
> The Pixie rolls a Narrative Success of 1 and subtracts the +2 Scale modifier to get a total Narrative Success of 0 (Narrative Success can not be turned to Narrative Failure) and deals a Level 0 Injury before Armour.

## Destiny

Cogent has a mechanic called **Destiny** used to shape the fate of the adventure. **Destiny** has two components, **Destiny Points** and the **Destiny Roll.**

### Destiny Points

All Characters start with a number of Destiny Points determined by their **Tier of Play.** They will typically get 1 Destiny Point per Chapter (1-3 campaign sessions) until they reach the maximum defined by their Tier.  Destiny Points are like a mechanism for Players to "Spend Luck" during a dice roll. A player may declare they would like to spend their Destiny Points before or after a dice roll.

Depending on when a Player declares it, **Destiny Points** will have different effects, as outlined below,

**Before a Dice Roll**

Choose one per **Destiny Point** spent:
* Gain +1D6 to your **Dice Pool** for this roll only.
* Gain **Advantage** on your **Dice Pool**
* If making an opposed Dice Rool, give the opponent **Disadvantage** on their **Dice Pool**
* Do not roll, instead take 1/2 (round down) of your **Dice Pool** as your roll

**After a Dice Roll**

Choose one per **Destiny Point** spent:
* Re-roll your **Dice Pool**
* If your dice roll results in a **Narrative Success,** increase your level of success
* If your dice roll results in a **Narrative Failure,** decrease your level of failure (a failure cannot be turned into a success)

### Destiny Rolls

Oftentimes in TTRPGs, scenarios occur where several dice rolls and skill checks need to be made for effects occurring "off-screen".  To prevent having to roll more dice than absolutely necessary, Cogent introduces a mechanic called the **Destiny Roll**.<br/>

All **Destiny Rolls** are done with a single twenty-sided dice, or 1D20.  The CL for the **Destiny Roll** is based on the difficulty of combined tasks.

| **Difficulty (%)** | 5% | 10% | 15% | 20% | 25% | 30% | 35% | 40% | 45% | 50% | 55% | 60% | 65% | 70% | 75% | 80% | 85% | 90% | 95% | 100% |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CL** | 20 | 19 | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 |

To generate a positive outcome, the **Destiny Roll** result must be equal to or greater than the CL for the roll.  **Destiny Rolls** are mostly used by **Narrators** when the actions of NPCs do not directly affect Player*.  This greatly speeds up gameplay by allowing the story to continue without pausing for long stretches of dice rolls.

*To Give an Example:*

> King John's men are traveling through Sherwood Forest with the latest taxes.  They know that Robin Hood and his Merry Men are planning to ambush the convoy, but King John's men have devised several new paths through the forest.<br/>
> Instead of rolling multiple Perception and General Knowledge checks to avoid an ambush point, the Narrator decides to perform a **Destiny Roll** for the convoy. <br/>
> The Narrator determines there is roughly a 75% chance the convoy will hit an ambush point, giving them a 25% chance to avoid them. The Narrator sets the **CL** for the **Destiny Roll** at **16** (100% - 75% = 25%). The Narrator rolls a **13,** or **a Narrative Failure of -3**. <br/>
> The convoy rolls right into the ambush, but their agitated state means they are not fully caught unaware. <br/>
