# Running the Game

This chapter is less of rules that Narrators must follow, and more of a toolbox of methods recommended to manager your Stories.  Narrators are encouraged to use the method that best fits the situation in the Story.

## Story Structure

**Cogent Roleplay** attempts to follow the structure and flow you will find in book series, TV shows, or plays.  Most *Campaigns* (a collection of *Stories*) will follow (loosely) the following structure:
* **Campaign:** This is the the whole collective story the Players and their Characters engage in.  It is similar to the entire book series, then entire TV show (all seasons), or the full collection of related plays.  *Campaigns* typically take years to complete.
* **Story:** *Campaigns* are broken into *Story*.  Each *Story* could act as an independent *Campaign*, or build on other *Story* to tell a grand overarching narrative.  It is similar to a single book in the series, a single season of a TV show, or a single play.  *Story* will take anywhere between 1 month, to 1 year to complete.
* **Act:** To make telling *Stories* easier, *Chapters* are grouped into *Acts*.  *Acts* are similar to Acts in a play in that they break up the *Story* into logical narrative parts.  They have no game play impact and are only used by *Narrators* to make planning *Stories* and *Campaigns* easier.
* **Chapter:** *Story* are broken into *Chapters*.  *Chapters* typically have a single narrative arc (a problem for the Characters to overcome), and *Chapters* follow the standard Story build-up, climax, and resolution arc typical to most stories.  It is similar to a chapter in a book, a show in a TV series, or an act in a play.  You can expect a *Chapter* to take between 1-3 gaming sessions to complete.
* **Scene:** *Chapters* are broken into *Scenes*.  A *Scene* builds up to a single challenge or opportunity for the Characters involved.  Typically, you will have one major Dice Roll per *Scene*.  It is similar to a page in a book, a scene in a TV show, or play.

## Narration

The role of the Narrator is to facilitate the flow of the Story.  You are there to ensure the Characters have the opportunity to play their part in the grand narrative, and that everyone collaborates in the creation of the Story.  

### Combat Encounters

A Combat Encounter is a Scene where violence between two or more Characters is occurring.  To manage the opposed interactions in a Combat Encounter, the following structure is typically used:

<!-- TODO -->

1. **Determine Initiative:** Using METHOD NAME to determine each Character's Initiative value, order this list in ascending order (smallest to largest).
2. **Declare Actions:** Starting from the top of the Initiative List, each Character declares what their Character wishes to accomplish this round.  Characters can make Declarations that will interfere with a previously stated Declaration.
3. **Make your Combat Roll:** All Characters determine their Combat Roll, and make their roll at the same time.
4. **Outcome:** Using the Declarations as a guide, the Narrator will state what the outcome of the Combat Rolls are.  
5. **Roleplay the Scene:** Using the Narrator's outcome the Characters will roleplay out the round of combat, and if the scene has not been concluded, another round of combat starts *(go back to step 1)*.

### Investigations

Investigations are one of the few encounter types that can be split across multiple *Scenes*.  Investigations are broken into two competing sides, ***Conspirators***, and ***Investigators***.  The Investigation is played out on an ***Investigation Grid***, and the outcome of the Investigation will determine how successful the ***Conspirators***, and ***Investigators*** are.

#### Investigation Grid

The Investigation grid is the "playing field" for the Investigation.  The center of the grid is the ***Conspirator***'s goal, and each ring out built up, or torn down as part of the Investigation.

#### Conspirators

Conspirators are attempting to achieve the goal of the Investigation, while not disclosing the W5 (Who, what, when, where, why) on how they did it.  

1. **Declare Actions:** The Conspirators declare their intended action to either progress towards the goal, or cover their tracks.  *Rules for Initiative as detailed in **Combat Encounters** may be used is needed.*
2. **Make an Investigation Roll:** 3D6 + Attribute + Vocation + Skill/Specialization + Modifiers
3. **Outcome:** The Narrator will move the Conspirators closer to the center of the *Investigation Grid*, or increase the CL for the step they are currently on.

#### Investigators

1. **Find a Clue:** The Narrator will present to the Investigators a clue to a Conspiracy.
2. **Declare Actions:** The Investigators declare how they are going to uncover more of the Conspiracy.  *Rules for Initiative as detailed in **Combat Encounters** may be used is needed.*
3. **Make an Investigation Roll:** 3D6 + Attribute + Vocation + Skill/Specialization + Modifiers
4. **Outcome:**
