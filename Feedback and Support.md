## Acknowledgements

### Thank you to the Founders

Every Story has a beginning, and every project has its founders.  **Cogent Roleplay** is the creation of [Josiah (Jazza) Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHu2KNu6TtJ0p4hpSW7Yv7Q) and [Shad Brooks](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkmMACUKpQeIxN9D9ARli1Q).  They were seeking to create a tabletop roleplaying game that addressed many of the issues they saw in the TTRPG industry at the time.  We of the **Cogent Community Project** wouldn't have been able to work on this project if it wasn't for them, and to that we owe them our thanks.

### Thank you to the Volunteers

The **Cogent Community Project** is a volunteer run organization that lives and dies by the hard work and dedication of our volunteers.  We, the project can not thank everyone who has contributed enough for every second you have given to this passion project.  We have created a community unlike any other in the TTRPG industry, and you should be proud.  

Special thanks go to the following:
* Our two Project Managers (Insanity and Javk)
* The various developers (names to follow)
* Our Playtesters (names to follow)
