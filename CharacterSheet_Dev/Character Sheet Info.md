As the core premise of the Cogent Community Project is to enable a high degree of variability within the system itself, we provide multiple versions of the standard core skills. Using the provided pages, players and narrators are able to pick their preferred version of the sheet:

- **CoCoPro V0.6 General** is the main page for any character. This page is required to be used.

- **CoCoPro V1.0 Skills** offers the vanilla CoCoPro edition core skills list. The skill names are all filled in for the easiest jump-start into Cogent.

- **CoCoPro V1.0 Skills alt** provides the same vanilla core skills list. The difference to the base version is the removal of a possible -1 in any vocation or vocational skill.

- **CoCoPro V1.0 Skills Blank** lets the group pick the skills to be represented in the core skill list. If you want to alter the core skills by any degree, this is your edition.

- **CoCoPro V1.0 Skills Blank alt** lets the group pick the skills to be represented in the core skill list. The difference to the base blank version is the removal of a possible -1 in any vocation or vocational skill.
